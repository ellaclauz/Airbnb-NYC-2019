## TAKEAWAYS
1. Among the 5 Boroughs of New York, Manhattan which is geographically the smallest and is the most densely populated, generates the highest revenue of over $792m for Airbnb in 2019. 

2. 51.97% of listings are Room Type Entire Home/Apartment (whole place to themselves including private entrance and no shared spaces). Entire Home is the most popular among Airbnb guests followed by Private Room. Also, majority of the listings are listed as Entire Room and Private Room.

3. Sonder(NYC) is the host with 327 listings, which is the highest of listing owned by one person in New York.

4. From this visualization, we can see that reviews of borough per month do not affect the average price of  a listing.

5. Investing in Manhattan is recommended since it is a high-demand area and it's average nightly cost for all room types are higher, which can return higher profits.
